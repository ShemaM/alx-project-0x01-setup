# Project Description

This project is a comprehensive Next.js web application that demonstrates fundamental concepts of modern web development. The application features multiple pages for displaying posts and users, with interactive components for adding new content. Built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js, the project showcases best practices in component-based architecture, state management, and API integration.

# Learning Objectives


Set up a Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
Implement dynamic page routing and navigation
Create reusable React components with proper TypeScript typing
Work with external APIs to fetch and display data
Implement modal dialogs for user interaction
Understand static site generation with getStaticProps
Manage component state with React hooks
Structure a project with proper directory organization
Apply responsive design principles with Tailwind CSS


# Requirements

# 1. Technical Requirements
Node.js (v16 or later)
npm or yarn
Next.js (latest version)
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
ESLint (for code quality)


# 2. Functional Requirements
Base Application Setup

Create Next.js app with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint
Configure proper folder structure
Set up global CSS with Tailwind directives
Navigation System

Implement header with navigation links
Set up routing between home, posts, and users pages
Ensure navigation works without page reloads
Posts Functionality

Display posts from JSONPlaceholder API
Create PostCard component for displaying individual posts
Implement PostModal for adding new posts
Handle form submission and state management
Users Functionality

Display users from JSONPlaceholder API
Create UserCard component for displaying user information
Implement UserModal for adding new users
Handle complex nested data structures
Best Practices
Component Architecture

Follow atomic design principles
Separate presentational and container components
Create reusable UI components (Button, Card, Modal)
Type Safety

Define proper TypeScript interfaces
Type all component props and state
Handle event types correctly
Styling

Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
Maintain consistent spacing and typography
Implement responsive design
State Management

Use React hooks for local state
Lift state up when necessary
Keep state minimal and focused
Project Structure

Organize components by feature/domain
Keep interfaces in a central location
Follow Next.js conventions for pages
Implementation Notes
The project uses JSONPlaceholder as a mock API
Static generation (getStaticProps) is used for initial data fetching
Modals demonstrate interactive UI patterns
TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety throughout the application
Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling
